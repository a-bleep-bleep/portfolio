        <h1>×  About me × </h1>
        <p>Hey I'm BleepBleep, I love Programming and Developing Applications, most of my work tends to lie in Compiler Development and Operating System Development. I have been programming for several years. Since early in my childhood I have always been fascinated and had a compelling interest in Computer Science and Programming, which is why today it is my hobby. I for now do NOT work as a professional developer, Programming is something I do aside as a hobby. (I am not a web-developer which is probably clearly visible lol).</p>
